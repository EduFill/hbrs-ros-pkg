# Point clouds that should be "packed" into boxes
sensor_msgs/PointCloud2[] clouds
# Force one of the axes of the bounding box to be
# colinear with this vector (optional)
geometry_msgs/Vector3 axis
# The "axis" parameter is useful when a cloud
# (object) is supported by a plane with known
# coefficients and therefore it makes sense to
# make the bottom of the box parallel to it.
